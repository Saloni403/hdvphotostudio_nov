				<h4>Plan together with your photographer</h4>
				<p>You could hire the <b>best wedding photographer</b>, but if you don’t
					communicate your desires and expectations or plan out the shots that you want for the event, the
					photographs aren’t going to come out the way that you wanted them to. Openly discuss the details
					with your wedding photographer so that you’re both on the same page. This will also help your
					photographer prepare for the big day and ensure that there will be no out-of-the-blue surprises.</p>
				<br>

				<h4>Discuss the shots that you want in advance</h4>
				<p>In light of planning, notify your wedding photographer about specific shots that you want during the
					event.
					Whether it’s the kiss, the cutting of the cake, the walk down the aisle, or even pre wedding
					preparations in the backroom, letting the photographer know that you want some pictures taken of
					these moments will increase the chances of a successful outcome for your wedding album. The
					<b>Indian wedding photographer</b> is likely aware of the best times to take photos due to his/her
					professional experience, but there are some instances where you might want to have shots taken in
					unorthodox situations. Discussing these in advance will make certain that every photo worth taking
					is accounted for.</p>
				<br>

				<h4>Set up locations ahead of time</h4>
				<p>Photography is all about angles. If you’re wedding photographer finds himself surrounded by a sea of
					wedding guests because you did not plan a proper location for him/her, taking excellent pictures is
					next to impossible. Setting up separate areas ahead of time that the photographer can use to capture
					different scenes of your wedding will minimize distractions and interruptions. It will also
					guarantee that your uncle’s bald head won’t suddenly pop out of nowhere and block the shot.</p>
				<br>

				<h4>Assign a family member to work with the wedding photographer</h4>
				<p>Having a family member work with the photographer and coordinate with the guests to ensure that
					everyone is included in important photos is essential. More often than not, the photographer does
					not know any of the guests intimately and may have trouble organizing everyone, especially in group
					photos. Working with a family member makes sure that no one is left out.</p>
				<br>

				<h4>Gathering moments for the future</h4>
				<p>The photographs from your wedding will provide memories that last a lifetime. They’re the only
					mementos that can invoke the myriad of emotions felt on your wedding day years after the event.
					Taking extra care in selecting the right wedding photographer and planning ahead for the shots that
					you want will go a long way in securing your photo album’s status as an attraction centerpiece
					rather than a cobweb collector in some dusty attic.</p>

					<p>A wedding photographer is there to capture each moment of your special day as it unfolds, while a
						wedding videographer captures the event on film so that you can watch your wedding video for
						years to come.</p>
					<p>Choosing the right videographer for your wedding is equally as important as choosing the right
						wedding photographer – each videographer will have a different style and unlike a photographer,
						you will most likely only receive one wedding video and there won’t be different versions for
						you to choose from. To help you select the <b>best wedding videographer</b>, we’ve got the 10 most important questions to ask your videographer to ensure that
						he is the ideal fit for you.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="s12">
					<br>
					<h4>What is your video style and storytelling approach?</h4>
					<p>There are typically two types of videography styles: <b>cinematic style wedding videography and
							documentary style wedding videography in india</b>. Cinematic videos are like movies and
						include music, special effects and montages. They involve the videographer shooting sections of
						the wedding and editing them together later. Documentary videos are generally shot consistently
						throughout the day and show the progression of the wedding day from start to finish. Make sure
						that you and your videographer are on the same page about what is expected from the final
						product and what kind of story you want your video to tell.</p>
					<br>

					<h4>How many weddings have you videoed?</h4>
					<p>Knowing how many weddings your videographer has worked will give you an idea of the level of
						professionalism and experience you will receive on your wedding day. It is important to hire a
						<b>professional wedding videographer</b> so that you receive a high-quality
						video of your special day, so be sure to choose someone whose experience level you feel
						comfortable with.</p>
					<br>

					<h4>What kind of equipment will you be using? How do you handle sound and lighting?</h4>
					<p>Although you may not be familiar with the technical terms, asking your potential videographer
						what kind of equipment he uses is an indicator of his level of expertise and also what the setup
						will look like at the wedding? Sometimes video gear can be very bulky and would interfere with
						the ceremony so you’ll want to double check that your videographer’s equipment won’t get in the
						way. Having good sound and lighting is crucial for a great video and all good videographers will
						have a way to capture the best sound and provide the best lighting for your wedding video.</p>
					<br>

					<h4>Do you have any sample movies and references?</h4>
					<p>Watching a sample movie is the best way to determine whether or not someone is a potential
						videographer for your wedding. If you watch a couple of sample videos and don’t feel that they
						are the type of video you want, you’ll know that videographer is not for you. If you watch a
						couple of videos and instantly fall in love, you’ll know that this videographer is someone you
						would want to work with. Asking for references is something that any <b>professional
							videographer</b> should be used to and be happy to provide. Speaking with past clients will
						help you gauge what to expect from this particular videographer for your special day.</p>
					<br>

					<h4>How much do you charge, and are there any package services? What is included in your packages?
					</h4>
					<p>Of course one of the most important things to ask your videographer is how much his services will
						cost. Many times videographers offer package deals that include their time, the video, editing
						and extra copies. Review all of the package options carefully to make sure everything you want
						and need is included at a price that you are comfortable with. Also ask about overtime charges
						in case the ceremony or reception runs long so that you aren’t surprised with extra costs when
						the bill comes.</p>
					<br>

					<h4>When can I expect to see the finished product?</h4>
					<p>Your wedding video will be a lovely keepsake for you and your loved ones to enjoy for years to
						come. Each videographer will spend a different amount of time on your video depending on his
						editing process and schedule; some may deliver your finished movie in as little as 8 weeks,
						while others may take up to an entire year. Ask your videographer what a typical turnaround time
						is for him so that you have an idea of when you’ll be able to see your beautiful movie.</p>
